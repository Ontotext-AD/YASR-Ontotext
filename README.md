## Developing YASR

Feel free to fork and develop this tool. If you have anything to contribute, submit a pull request.
To develop this tool locally, I'd advice to use the following procedure:


* Make sure npm and gulp are installed or use local gulp as bellow, gulp need to be version 3.x.x, errors may occur with with gulp 4 or higher
* It's recommended to install nvm and use npm version v6.11.0
* Run `npm install` from the base dir
# Run with LIBSASS_EXT="no" npm install if you have gulp-sass error
* Run ./node_modules/gulp/bin/gulp.js to create packages
